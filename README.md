2. Create a Branch: Using the following naming convention "your-name-year", create a new branch where "your-name" is the applicant's name, and "year" is the current year.

3. Create a New Markdown File: In the branch, create a new markdown (.md) file with the same naming convention used for the branch. For example, "your-name-year.md".
